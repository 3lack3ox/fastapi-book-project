    branches:
      - main  # This triggers when changes are pushed to the main branch (usually after a PR merge)

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # This specifies that the job will run on an Ubuntu machine

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Checkout the latest code from the repository

      # Step 2: Set up Python
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'  # Use Python version 3.12 (or change to your preferred version)

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m venv venv  # Create a virtual environment
          source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
          pip install --upgrade pip  # Upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install the required dependencies

      # Step 4: Deploy the application to your server (e.g., using SSH)
      - name: Deploy to server
        run: |
          # Ensure private key is available
          mkdir -p ~/.ssh  # Create the .ssh directory if it doesn't exist
          echo "${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}" > ~/.ssh/id_rsa  # Adds the private key to the runner
          chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa  # Secures the key with the right permissions

          # This example uses SSH to deploy the app, replace with your actual deployment process
          ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@184.72.123.253 << 'EOF'
            cd /home/ubuntu/fastapi-book-project  # Navigate to your app directory
            git pull origin main  # Pull the latest code from GitHub
            source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
            pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install any new dependencies
            # Restart the app with Uvicorn or your chosen method
            pkill -f 'uvicorn'  # Kill any existing Uvicorn process
            uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload &
